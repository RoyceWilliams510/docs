# Practice Planner Documentation

<Info>
  This page documents the current setup, logic, and open questions for the
  Practice Planner system.
</Info>

## <Icon icon="table-layout" size={24} />  Current Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="**Videos** are pulled from storage `drills/foldername`">
    
  </Step>
  <Step title="Google Sheet contains title, description, and link:`">
    - Link is currently to the MyTPI website for the drill.
    - If using MyTPI video, export the embedded video link and add to the spreadsheet.
    - This allows loading the video in an iframe or media player.
    - This approach means no longer using storage videos (which were placeholders); refactor storage to reference the CSV file for video links.
  </Step>
  <Step title="If the drill does not exist in `practice_activities.csv`, fetch from `drills.csv` and label golf areas as 'off the tee'">
    - Prefer using `practice_activities.csv` as it has more relevant fields.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Saved practice plans are stored as a document in a subcollection under the user's document.">
    
  </Step>
</Steps>

## <Icon icon="question" size={24} /> Open Questions

<Info>
  Is the "social media golf drill database" the desired DB to pull drills from, or is it the "golf drill database"?
</Info>

<Info>
  What is the difference between drills and games in `drills.csv` vs `practice_activities.csv`?
</Info>

<Info>
  When should each be used? How do they relate to plan generation?
</Info>

<Info>
  What about plus handicaps?

## <Icon icon="lightbulb-exclamation" size={24} /> Practice Plan Generation Logic

<Steps>
  <Step title="generatePracticePlan(userInput)">
    - `userInput` example:

      ```js
      {
        handicap: parseInt(formData.handicap, 10),
        daysAvailable: parseInt(formData.daysAvailable, 10),
        timePerDay: parseInt(formData.timePerDay, 10),
        biggestMisses: formData.biggestMisses || [],
        contactIssues: formData.contactIssues || [],
        desiredBallFlight: formData.desiredBallFlight || '',
        clubsToImprove: formData.clubsToImprove || [],
      }
      ```
    - Get drills from `drills.csv` (will change to new spreadsheet when ready)
    - Practice activities drills are deprecated?
  </Step>
  <Step title="generatePracticePlanLogic(userInput, drills, practiceActivities?)">
    - **assignDifficultyLevel(handicap)**
      - Low: handicap ≤ 9
      - Medium: 10 ≤ handicap \< 20
      - High: handicap \> 20
    - **filterDrills(drills, difficultyLevel)**
      - Remove logic for equipment
      - Instead of L1-L4, use high/medium/low (columns o, p, q)
      - Return drills matching only difficulty, then filter further by other inputs
    - **filterActivities(activities, equipment)**
      - May be deprecated
    - **scoreDrills(drills, biggestMisses, contactIssues, desiredBallFlight)**
      - Previous: Score by keyword matches in description
      - Potential: Also search columns for ball flight/contact issues (marked with 'x')
    - **allocateDrillsToDays(scoredDrills, filteredActivities, daysAvailable, timePerDay, difficultClubs, clubsToImprove)**
      - Parse `timePerDay`
        - Potential: Allocate all time to drills if activities are deprecated
      - Parse `clubsToImprove` into `focusClubs`
        - Potential: Only use `clubsToImprove` (remove `difficultClubs`)
      - Rank clubs by priority (from questionnaire)
      - Build `allAvailableDrills` by club
        - Use 'x' in "Applies to which club or clubs" column
        - Remove duplicates, normalize titles
      - Compute `totalDrillTime`, `averageDrillDuration`, `maxAssignmentsPerDrill`
      - Track assignments per activity/drill
      - For each day, assign drills by club priority, avoiding duplicates and spreading out repeats
      - Store day plans under `practicePlan["Day ${day}"]`
      - Return `practicePlan`
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Outstanding Tasks

- Fill out new spreadsheet and add to bucket (Drake, in progress) ✅
- Adjust time barriers to slider
- Change all questions to Drake's new questions (Royce, todo)
- Figure out if activity list is still needed ❓
- Play with iframes and research embedded social media clips for frontend ❓
